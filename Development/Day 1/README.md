# Day 1 – JavaScript Variables & Data Types

## What I built

- CLI Greeting Generator using Node.js

## Concepts used

- let / const
- string interpolation (template literals)
- basic input/output

## What I learned

- Why const is default, let only when reassignment is needed
- How Node executes a JS file outside the browser

## Next

- Conditionals + CLI logic (BMI Calculator)
