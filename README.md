# 100 Days of Full Stack + DSA (Build in Public)

This repository documents my **100 Days of Code** journey focused on:
- Full Stack Web Development
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Building real, working projects in public

The goal is not just to learn, but to become **engineering-ready** by writing code daily,
solving real problems, and shipping projects.

## 🔄 Roadmap Update (Transparency)

I started this challenge with a general learning approach.  
After reviewing industry research and hiring expectations, I **upgraded my path** to a more
engineering-focused **150-Day Full Stack Roadmap**.

👉 This is a **strategy upgrade, not a restart**.  
Daily commits continue without breaking the **100 Days of Code** challenge.
